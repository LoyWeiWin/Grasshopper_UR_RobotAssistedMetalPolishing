# Robot-Assisted Metal Polishing using Grasshopper

## Overview
This project explores how Grasshopper can be used to communnicate with collaborative robot, UR10 for metal polishing tasks, from standard linihisng to complex metal pieces that bolted in an angle.

## Key Features
- *software architecture*
- *optional internet access* 

## Repository Structure
- `GrasshopperFiles/`: Grasshopper scripts.
- `RhinoFiles/`: Robot workcell, and end-effectors.
- `HardwareIntegration/`: Wiring diagrams, component details, and setup instructions.
- `Data/`: Input/output data and logs for testing.
- `Docs/`: Documentation for installation, usage, and troubleshooting.

For more details, see the [Documentation](./Docs/).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/template.git
2. Replace placeholder files (e.g., `.gitkeep`) with your project files.
3. Customize the scripts and models to fit your project.
