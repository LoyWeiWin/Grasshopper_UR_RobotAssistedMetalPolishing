# Robot-Assisted Metal Polishing using Grasshopper

## Overview
This project explores how Grasshopper can be used to communicate with the Universal Robots UR10 collaborative robot for various metal polishing tasks. These tasks range from standard finishing to handling complex metal pieces mounted at various angles. The system leverages Grasshopper's parametric design capabilities and integrates advanced plugins to achieve precise control and high-quality results.
