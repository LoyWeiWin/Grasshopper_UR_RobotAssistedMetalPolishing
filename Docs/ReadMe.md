# Robot-Assisted Metal Polishing using Grasshopper

## Overview
This project explores how Grasshopper can be used to communnicate with collaborative robot, UR10 for metal polishing tasks, from standard linihisng to complex metal pieces that bolted in an angle.

## Components
- Universal Robot, UR10 (as example).
- Robotiq Sanding Kit.
- Rhinoceros 3D
- Grasshopper

## Repository Structure
- `GrasshopperFiles/`: Grasshopper scripts.
- `RhinoFiles/`: Robot workcell, and end-effectors.
- `Assets/`: Images, thumbnails and videos
- `Docs/`: Documentation for installation, setup instructions, usage, and troubleshooting.

For more details, see the [Documentation](./Docs/).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/robot-.git
2. Customize the scripts and models to fit your project.
