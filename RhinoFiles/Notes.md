##Environment
- Given the limited size that can be stored on github, high complex geometries for UR's teach pendant and control box have been omitted in the 3dm file. If you wish to include the geometries, the links are attached below. Please be note that any complex geometries would demand high computational power which in turn reduce the efficiency of your workflow. Cheers.
