## Environment
- The environment file should contain the following items
  - Robot Workcell
  - Example metal pieces
  - End effector - [Robotiq Sanding Kit](https://robotiq.com/products/sanding-kit)
 
- Given the limited storage capacity on GitHub, high-complexity geometries for the UR's teach pendant and control box have been omitted from the .3dm file. If you wish to include these geometries, the relevant download links are provided below.
- **Note:** Be aware that incorporating complex geometries may require significant computational power, which could reduce the efficiency of your workflow.
